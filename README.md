## CS179 Final Project

This product suggests how much food to purchase based on relevant predictors (time, day of week, weather, month, holiday, etc.) by automating the analytical and predictive processes of purchasing food. Through this product, we hope to address the root problem: purchasing food. Instead of having managers look numbers up in an Excel spreadsheet and estimate how much food they should buy for the day or the week, our product automatically calculates that for them, enabling managers to focus on more important tasks such as budgeting and managing profit margins. More importantly, because the algorithm has thousands of data points of purchase history and food prepared at its disposal, it would vastly improve on estimations and would reduce the amount of extraneous food purchased. 

We used a template taken from http://lbd-react.creative-tim.com/#/dashboard.
